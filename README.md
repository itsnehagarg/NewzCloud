**Performance :** This is a light weighted app which fetches the data from different sources and consumes the APIs. We did a performance testing to check if multiple users are using the app simultaneously. And in the results we found that the app can be used by the several users simultaneoulsy.

**Security:** This app is not storing any personalised data of the user as of now and therefore, we did not plan to implement the database security. However, certain validations and testing parameters are placed to make sure that the app is secure and the privacy of the user is maintained.

**Future Scope:** Certain features can be added to the app in the future which were not considered in the current scope of this project are mentioned below.
Future Prospects or features that can be integrated:
